This Is my first project ever in python i was create it in 2016 i was a rookie person and this was my first time to program something like that i use the Module Name : Math To made this big calculator it's still under upgrade i just was made it and i found it so i will 
use some of machine learning on it soon as possible So Now i just compile the script..into .EXE 

No One Thing That There's A Operations That needs one Argumnet so i make 2 input fields 
one req from you the first num and the other req from u the second num 
so i put a expetion in the Usage Function Read it carefuly to know  how to use as well
